# Olympic-Discus-Lines

This was a data visualization made with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and d3. It was made for my senior year IMS 261 class at Miami University.

The goal of this project was to represent an interesting story using some portion of Olympics data through an interactive visual display. In my work, I chose to show the progress of the sport of discus over time. I used the JavaScript library, d3 to program the visuals and interaction.
